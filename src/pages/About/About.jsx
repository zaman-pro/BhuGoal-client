        BhuGoal is a collaborative group-study platform built to make learning
        with friends easier, smarter, and more engaging. We understand that
        studying alone can sometimes feel overwhelming, so we've created a space
        where students can connect, share resources, and support each other in
        achieving their academic goals.

        to make learning collaborative and enjoyable.
